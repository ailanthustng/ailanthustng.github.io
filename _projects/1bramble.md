A simple API keys management application

- Built a front-end application to manage API keys for different applications to gain experience using React.
- Understood React state and lifecycle features and utilized Hooks to tap into its functionalities such as establishing the initial state, updating the list of API keys, deleting/creating API keys via function calls to the back-end server.
